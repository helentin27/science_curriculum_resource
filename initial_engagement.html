                    One day, a child walked into the school with a small wire cage.
                    In the cage, there was a tiny furry animal comfortably lying inside
                    a plastic bowl. Three other children approached and one of them said,
                    "Is it a hamster? It is very furry." Another child added, "Yes,
                    it is very furry. Why? My froggy at home has no fur at all."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Children began to wonder and raise the question about animals'
                    skin. That was the moment when their investigation started to expand.
