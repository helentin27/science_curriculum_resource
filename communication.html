                    Communication is the last stage in the inquiry-based learning process.
                    This is the stage where children were invited to share their findings
                    and new ideas. Children were encouraged to involve their parents/grandparents
                    in their investigation process in order to enrich their discoveries.
                    After sharing each child shared their new ideas and made a connection
                    with their prior knowledge, they decided to create a wall-size map.
                    In this map, children will be using drawing, words, colouring, and
                    materials to identify each animal’s skin and its function (if there’s
                    any), their behaviours, sizes, colours, and diet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this experience, children spontaneously engaged into life science.
                    From learning about the physical characteristics of living things to
                    discovering simple behaviours of living things, children were
                    successfully integrating their skills in comparing, sorting,
                    classifying, and representing during the process of peer learning.
