                    At this stage, children were provided a vast variety of materials
                    and resources. Including books, pictures, and video that illustrated
                    the different types of animal’s skin and the function of their skin.
                    The following were the resources that children used throughout their
                    investigation:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Investigating why animals shed their skin by Ellen Rene</li>
                        <li>Zeek’ s animal world furry friends (DVD)</li>
                        <li>Chamelons and other animals with amazing skin by Susan LaBella</li>
                        <li>Animal groups by Anita Ganeri</li>
                        <li>Mountain creatures by Sujatha Menon</li>
                        <li>Animal habitats: Why and how animals live where they do by (DVD)</li>
                        <li>Animals around the world by Samantha Gray</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    While children were reading through the materials, they were able to relate
                    some of the new knowledge with their prior knowledge written on the chart,
                    and to create sub categories such as: animals with scales, animals live in
                    the water, in a home, in a cave, and in the wild. The expansion of children’s
                    thoughts was simply led by rich materials, educator’s guidance and peer collaboration.

                    Throughout this stage, children were encouraged to utilize their observation skills and
                    interpretation to draw conclusion of their findings and share with their peers. Therefore,
                    communication is a significant element to be used in inquiry-based learning process.

                    As a facilitator, let’s have some fun to observe, modify our plan, and constantly reflect
                    on children’s learning process and our role as an educator.
