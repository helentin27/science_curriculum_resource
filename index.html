                <p>
                    I am very delighted to share with you one of my learning experiences
                    I had with a group of kindergarten children. This learning journey
                    allowed us to wonder and explore about life science through engaging
                    conversation, observation, discussion and resource gathering. This
                    experience helped me to capture the power of children's
                    learning through the learning area of science.

                    In science, we want to capitalize on children's natural disposition
                    to learn about their world. We, as facilitators, should focus on
                    three <strong>big ideas</strong> regarding their innate abilities. According to the Full Day Early Learning
                    Kindergarten (<abbr title="Full Day Early Learning
                    Kindergarten">FDELK</abbr>) curriculum, "Children
                    are curious and connect prior knowledge to new contexts in order to
                    understand the world around them." But they depend on us to give
                    them rich environments for inquiry and to develop their child-guided
                    discoveries into a growing understand of how science works. Children
                    grow naturally from wondering, noticing, and observing about the objects
                    around them to exploring, questioning, and experimenting in a more
                    focused way. Therefore, it is important for us to demonstrate our
                    knowledge of inquiry-based learning and its process involving:

                </p>
                <p>
                    As children progress through the <abbr title="Full Day Early Learning
                    Kindergarten">FDELK</abbr> curriculum in the learning of science, they are able to
                    achieve specific learning outcomes, including:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <a href="specific_expectations_science.html#children-explore-1">
                                ask questions about and describe some natural occurrences,
                                using their own observations and representations
                            </a>
                        </li>

                                explore patterns in the natural and built environment
                            </a>
                        </li>
                        <li>

                                make predictions and observations before and during investigations

                        </li>

                </p>
                <p>
                    Secondly, it is vital for young children to see themselves as
                    individuals who talk, listen, read, write, and view media texts in order
                    to make sense of their world. According to <abbr title="Full Day Early Learning
                    Kindergarten">FDELK</abbr> curriculum, "Children are
                    effective communicators." Through this learning process, children
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <a href="specific_expectations_language.html#children-explore-1">
                                are able to listen and respond to others for a variety of purposes.
                            </a>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="specific_expectations_language.html#children-explore-2">
                                use language in various contexts to connect new experiences with what they already know.
                            </a>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="specific_expectations_language.html#children-explore-3">
                                use specialized vocabulary for a variety of purposes.
                            </a>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="specific_expectations_language.html#children-explore-4">
                                describe personal experiences, using vocabulary and details appropriate to the situation.
                            </a>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Learning through arts can foster children's imagination, expressive skill,
                    creativity thinking, symbolic communication and sensory development.
                    Therefore, we must believe that According to <abbr title="Full Day Early Learning
                    Kindergarten">FDELK</abbr> curriculum,, "Young children have an innate openness to
                    artistic activities." As children approach the learning process through arts,
                    children can
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <a href="specific_expectations_art.html#children-explore-1">
                                explore a variety of tools, materials, and processes of their own choice to create visual art forms in familiar and new ways.
                            </a>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="specific_expectations_art.html#children-explore-2">
                                explore different elements of design.
                            </a>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="specific_expectations_art.html#children-explore-3">
                                use problem-solving skills and their imagination to create visual art forms.
                            </a>
                        </li>

                    As we can see, the curiosity of animals' skin can lead to many different learning
                    domains, including science, language, art and more. Indeed, the direction we may take
                    will depend upon a number of things. Such as our need to cover different aspects of the
                    curriculum or our ability to respond to children's initiating interests; the ages and
                    capabilities of the children; and the availability and access to interesting resources.
                    In order for us to visualize and accommodate children's conceivable learning direction,
                    the use of a <a href="https://coggle.it/diagram/54289e5d62859cdf0c00f9bd/fd3949012d9b9648523bf828cbccc77e8e05a9410e68ffb8829965c313c0bc65">mind map</a> is beneficial for us while engaging in an
                    inquiry-based learning process. Most importantly, we must honour the principles and
                    approaches highlighted in the Full Day Early Learning Kindergarten curriculum, provide
                    children the opportunities to form the foundation of intellectual, social, physical, and
                    emotional skills for success in school and in life.
