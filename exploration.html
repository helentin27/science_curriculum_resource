                    In this stage, I acted as a facilitator to guide children with
                    thoughtful and open-ended questions, in order to expand their
                    curiosity. I first observed and jotted down children's prior
                    knowledge about animals" skin. They talked about:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            What they saw in the zoo and how some of the animals have fur and some don't.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Animals in different sizes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Animals have long hair, spiky hair, short hair and no hair.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Snakes and fish have scales.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    While children were sharing their prior knowledge and experiences,
                    they decided to move one step further and to create a chart.
                    In this chart, animals were separated into two categories:
                    <em>Animals with fur and Animals without fur</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I asked them, "Why do you think animals have different
                    types of skin?" One child responded, "I don't know." I added,
                    "Do you want to find out?" and <strong>they all agreed</strong>. At that
                    point, we were all committed to the next process called investigation.
